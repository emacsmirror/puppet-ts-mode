;;; Commentary:

;; This package uses a Tree-sitter parser to provide syntax highlighting,
;; indentation, alignment, completion, xref navigation and code checking
;; for the Puppet domain-specific language.
;;
;; Syntax highlighting: Fontification is supported using custom faces for
;;   Puppet syntax elements like comments, strings, variables, constants,
;;   keywords, resource types and their metaparameters.  Syntax errors can be
;;   shown using a warning face by setting `treesit-font-lock-level' to 4.
;;
;; Indentation: Automatic indentation according to the Puppet coding
;;   standards is provided.
;;
;; Alignment: Alignment rules for common Puppet expressions are included.
;;   The function `puppet-ts-align-block' (bound to "C-c C-a") aligns the
;;   current block with respect to "=>" for attributes and hashes or "=" for
;;   parameter lists.  The fat arrow and equal sign are electric and they
;;   perform automatic alignment.  Electricity is controlled by
;;   `puppet-ts-greater-is-electric' and `puppet-ts-equal-is-electric'.
;;
;; Completion: The mode updates the `completion-at-point' component to
;;   complete variable names and resource types.  Tree-sitter is used to
;;   extract the local variable names from the current buffer.
;;
;; Imenu: Navigation to the resource types and variable assignments used in
;;   a file is implemented using the imenu facility.
;;
;; Cross-reference navigation: When point is on an identifier for a class,
;;   defined type, data type or custom function, the definition of that
;;   element can easily be opened with `xref-find-definitions' (bound to
;;   "M-.").  The list of directories that will be searched to locate the
;;   definition is customized in `puppet-ts-module-path'.
;;
;; Code checking: Validate the syntax of the current buffer with
;;   `puppet-ts-validate' (bound to "C-c C-v").  Lint the current buffer for
;;   semantic errors with `puppet-ts-lint' (bound to "C-c C-l").  Apply the
;;   current buffer in noop-mode with `puppet-ts-apply' (bound to "C-c C-c").
;;
;; The package uses a Tree-sitter library to parse Puppet code and you need
;; to install the appropriate parser.  This can be done by using this Elisp
;; code:
;;
;;    (require 'puppet-ts-mode)
;;    (puppet-ts-mode-install-grammar)
;;
;; Note that a C compiler is required for this step.  Using the function
;; provided by the package ensures that a version of the parser matching the
;; package will be installed.  These commands should also be used to update
;; the parser to the correct version when the package is updated.

  "Major mode for editing Puppet files, using the Tree-sitter library.
\\<puppet-ts-mode-map>
Syntax highlighting for standard Puppet elements (comments,
string, variables, keywords, resource types, metaparameters,
functions, operators) is available.  You can customize the
variable `treesit-font-lock-level' to control the level of
fontification.

The function `completion-at-point' (bound to \\[completion-at-point])
can be used for completion.  It completes variable names if the
symbol at point starts with the \"$\" character.  The suggestions
include variables already used in the current buffer and all
variable names customized in `puppet-ts-completion-variables'.
Completion of variable names also works for interpolated
variables in a string when the symbol at point starts with
a \"${\" prefix.
If the symbol at point does not start with the \"$\" character,
the completion will use the resource type names customized in
`puppet-ts-completion-resource-types'.

Attribute and parameter blocks can be aligned with respect to the
\"=>\" and \"=\" symbols by positioning point inside such a block
and calling `puppet-ts-align-block' (bound to \\[puppet-ts-align-block]).

The greater sign is electric when used to insert a fat arrow
\"=>\" in a hash or attribute list and it will perform automatic
alignment of the structure.  You can disable this by customizing
`puppet-ts-greater-is-electric'.

The equal sign is electric when used in a parameter list and it
will perform automatic alignment of the structure.  You can
disable this by customizing `puppet-ts-equal-is-electric'.

Typing a \"$\" character inside a double quoted string will
insert the variable interpolation syntax.  The \"$\" character
will be followed by a pair of braces so that the variable name to
be interpolated can be entered immediately.  If the region is
active when the \"$\" character is entered, it will be used as
the variable name.

With `imenu' (bound to \\[imenu]) you can find the resource types
and variables used the current manifest.  For variables the
location of the initial assignment is used.  Puppet variables are
immutable so this is normally the only place in the file where
the variable is set.

The mode supports the cross-referencing system described in the
Info node `Xref'.  The variable `puppet-ts-module-path' can be
customized to contain a list of directories that are used to find
other Puppet modules.

Calling the function `xref-find-definitions' (\\[xref-find-definitions]) with point on
an identifier (a class, defined type, custom function or data
type) jumps to the file and location where that identifier is
defined.  This works without any sort of database or file that
otherwise might hold stale references.  Instead the Puppet
autoloader rules are used to infer the file name from the
identifier.

By convention a Puppet manifest only has a single definition of
a class, defined type or function.  So the navigation function
`beginning-of-defun' and `end-of-defun' would normally only jump
to the beginning or the end of the buffer.  This does not provide
any benefit and so the mode uses the associated keybindings to go
to the preceding (\\[treesit-beginning-of-defun]) or the following (\\[treesit-end-of-defun]) resource
declaration.  Putting the region around this declaration by
calling the function `mark-defun' (\\[mark-defun]) comes for free.

The manifest in a buffer can be applied in noop-mode (\\[puppet-ts-apply])
and validated (\\[puppet-ts-validate]).  The \"puppet\" executable is required
for this to work.

A manifest can also be linted (\\[puppet-ts-lint]) if the \"puppet-lint\"
utility is available.

A number of skeletons have been implemented to make insertion of
often used code fragments simpler.

The mode needs the Tree-sitter parser for Puppet code.  A parser
suitable for the current package version can be installed using
the function `puppet-ts-mode-install-grammar'.  Development tools
like a C compiler are required for this.  The constant
`puppet-ts-mode-treesit-language-source' contains the location
and version of the parser that should be used for the present
release of the mode.

Indentation, alignment and fontification depend on the concrete
syntax tree returned by the Tree-sitter parser.  Syntax errors
like a missing closing parenthesis or bracket can lead to wrong
indentation or missing fontification.  This is easily resolved by
fixing the particular syntax error.
